### In this project I used React JS with hooks:
- `useState()`
- `useEffect()`

## Interesting features impelemented:
- Created the contact form by using `useState()` hook to handle all inputs
- Used `useEffect()` hook to monitor any changes in inputs and save in `localStore`
- Used canditional rendering, when the form is submitted (display success message)
